Minimal and performant fade slideshow written in pure JavaScript that leans as much as possible on CSS animations. Responsiveness is native, no resize listener. Uses your elements, doesn't detach them or clone them. Provided as ESM and IIFE.

### Features

- No dependencies
- Small footprint
- CSS animations, transition duration is set in CSS
- ESM and IIFE
- Adaptive height (also animated)
- Responsive (no resize listener)
- Uses your elements, doesn't detach them or clone them
- Supports touch events (swipe) and mouse events (swipe simulation)
- Supports infinite loop
- Custom next and prev buttons
- No CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) if you set initial classes and start from the first slide
